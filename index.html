          <p> Welcome to my website. I've always had a love for drawing
             and computers so a Bachelor's degree in Web Design and Development seemed like 
             the perfect fit. It's a fun field but I quickly realized that it requires a lot
              of work and attention to detail. As you explore my site, I hope you can see that
               I have what it takes to be a Web Designer. </p>

           <p>This portfolio was the final project for my Print Design class. Throughout the semester, I gathered 
              images of my work completed at my university within the graphic design curriculum.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://web-projects.net/mamas-unidas/" target="_blank">Capstone Project Reflection</a></h2>
          <p>The previous semesters prepared me for designing a website for real clients.
              On the first day of class, my teachers placed me in a group with two of my
               classmates. We were assigned to our non- profit organization, Mamas Unidas (Mamas
               United). They help primarily the Hispanic community understand the education process
                in the USA. They host events and workshops, have one-on-one conferences with students
                and parents, and even give out scholarships.</p>

          <p>Each group had to have a name so we called our group the Los Guerreros (The Warriors). We wrote a 
             charter and met the clients to discuss their site. Their current site had been one long page. When you got to the bottom, you had to scroll
             back up. The whole site was in Spanish. When it was translated, there were areas that didn’t
              translate properly. Sometimes translate wasn’t offered depending on the browser. They had many
              links and we found some that didn’t work. It was sad that they paid someone $300 and this is
              what they got. Afterwards we compared notes and drew an outline plan designing their
             site.</p>

          <p>With our group being so small, we agreed specific roles were unnecessary besides the project
              manager. We were used to using the text editor Cloud Nine but it was no longer an option for
                building their website so we used Wordpress. We chose the theme Hestia Pro. Though we were
                familiar with Wordpress, we had never used a new editing feature in Wordpress called Elementor.
              It took some time but we worked with it until we figured it out.</p>
          
           <p>By this point, we knew that the new site would have six main pages on the home navigation bar.
              I was given the task of designing the About Us and Events pages. Our clients shared with us a Google
               drive that had all of the documents we needed. That’s where we got most of our information. We all 
               worked independently on our own pages and spent lots of time just tinkering with our theme and Elementor.
               We had to reset our theme and start from scratch at one point.</p>
            
          <p>This time we used the documentation to help us. If I needed any help both of my teammates were there for me. After
           I got the hang of it, working with Elementor was fun. It made many things easier that I would otherwise 
          have to code from scratch. The drag and drop feature made adding content easy from a designer perspective.
           I don’t think it would be considered easy for someone trying to make a site who knows nothing about web design.</p>
            
          <p>As we got closer to the presentation date, we came together to make suggestions for each other’s pages.
                 Some things that we had decided individually were changed. We used the same template for some pages to 
                 make it easier on the client when adding content. We confirmed font type, color scheme, and page structures.
                Before the presentation, we met to go over the order of how we would speak and transition to the
                 next person. I definitely felt more confident about speaking because of that.</p>
                 
           <p>Still, I was glad when it was over. A huge weight was lifted off my 
                 shoulders. Our client was very happy with the new site. Before we even finished the new one, they had already
                  disabled the old one. We plan to meet during the Thanksgiving break to make sure the client understands how 
                  to use the site.  Each semester I learn so much about web design. I wish I could take this class again because
                   I can still learn something I didn’t know.  I’m grateful for this experience. I will miss my teachers for this class.</p>
