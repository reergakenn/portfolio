                        interest to me was the US Constitution. Itâ€™s an important document that has been shaped by the passage of time.

                     <h5>Chrome Canvas Tutorial</h5>
                    <p>I had to create a well-focused video tutorial to teach a specific software skill of my choice. 
                        I chose to make a beginner's tutorial for Chrome Canvas. My video is almost 30 min long. I used 
                        Apowersoft, a free online screen recorder. Adobe Premiere Pro was used for the editing and captions. </p>

                    <p>This video is part 2 of the Chrome Canvas Tutorial. Viewers learn about a feature called <i>New From Image</i>.
                        My video is almost 9 min long. Apowersoft (screen recorder) and Adobe Premiere Pro (editing and captions) are 
                        used for this video as well. </p>

                    <h5> Scene Recreation</h5>
                    <p>In my Media Production class, my partner and I  had to recreate a scene from a movie. We found
                       the location, actors, and props we would need. Shooting the scene as close to the original as
                      possible was our main goal. That included getting the right frame, height, lighting, and character
                      portrayal. This scene was recreated from a film called <i>Person to Person</i>.</p>
